# Wage Gap Dash App

The General Social Survey (GSS) has gathered data relating to US employment. I used their 2018 dataset containing information on gender, education, pay, and socioeconomic background for respondants, as well as responses to several statements regarding traditional gender roles. Using exploratory data analysis with NumPy and Pandas, I was able to find some insights into the gender pay gap. Plotly was used to create various plots, and all were deployed on Heroku using Plotly-Dash to create a small interactive web app.
